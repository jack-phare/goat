# File Read Limits

When reading files:
- By default, reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files)
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
